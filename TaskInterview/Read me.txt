Hi, to explain the project
I initially built the main interface using Tinker and Pandas

After building the interface, I have built the associations for each of the buttons in the interface
1- The Add button: where the task to be added is entered, you add it to the program interface, and then you add it to the file
2- Update button: You can click on any of the tasks that you previously entered, and after clicking, you can press the edit button, 
and thus another window will open asking you to enter the new value in which the task that was selected will be updated 
3- Delete button: When you click on one of these tasks, you can delete any of the tasks you want
4- Complete button: When you click on any of the tasks and then click on the Finish button, 
the color of the task will change to gray, meaning that the task has been completed.

Every icons on the GUI consider as a Buttons
